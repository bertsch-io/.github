# Bertsch Innovation GmbH 🚀

Welcome to the official GitHub home of Bertsch Innovation. We are a leading software manufacturer specializing in **Omnichannel Product & Media Communication**. 

For over 25 years, we’ve been the "Single Source of Truth" for over 1,000 customers worldwide, helping them bridge the gap between structured product data and creative digital assets.

## 🛠 What We Build
Our flagship product, **mediacockpit**, is a powerhouse platform that combines:
* **PIM (Product Information Management):** Managing complex product hierarchies and attributes.
* **DAM (Digital Asset Management):** Centralizing and linking media assets to SKUs.
* **Omnichannel Syndication:** Automating content delivery to e-commerce, print, and social touchpoints.

## 🧩 Our Product Ecosystem
In addition to **mediacockpit** — our enterprise-grade PIM/DAM and syndication platform — Bertsch Innovation also delivers a set of complementary products and solutions that help organizations tame product content complexity across domains and use cases.

### 🚗 Automotive PIM (APIM)
We build **Automotive PIM (APIM)** solutions tailored for the **Automotive Aftermarket** — designed to manage vast variant trees, high-velocity master data updates, and complex relationships between vehicles, parts, and fitment data. APIM helps OEMs, tier-1 suppliers, and distributors consolidate product definitions and deliver consistent product information into e-commerce, ERP, and service channels.

### 📘 e-proCAT — B2B Catalog & Classification
**e-proCAT** is our software for creating, validating, enriching, and classifying **electronic B2B product catalogs**. It supports major catalog standards (e.g., BMEcat) and classification systems (ETIM, ECLASS, UNSPSC), accelerates catalog generation, improves data quality, and unlocks new sales channels by ensuring catalogs are compliant and discoverable.

### 🤖 0711.io — AI-Driven Enterprise Platform
**0711.io** is our next-generation AI-centric stack and **enterprise-grade platform** for building sovereign, high-performance applications. Designed around AI models and data autonomy, it provides a flexible foundation for use cases like intelligent data processing, automation workflows, and domain-specific reasoning — all deployable on-premises or in European sovereign clouds.
